To complete the required questions and additional exploration of the network dataset, we will proceed step by step. Let's start by loading the dataset and creating the undirected weighted network based on the given criteria.

Step 1: Loading the Dataset
We'll assume that you have already downloaded and saved the CSV file containing the MOSS result. Let's load the data into a Pandas DataFrame.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('moss_result.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the data
data.head()
Step 2: Creating the Undirected Weighted Network
Now, we will create the undirected weighted network using the NetworkX library in Python. We'll iterate over the rows of the DataFrame and add edges between student IDs that have at least 10% overlap in their submissions. The weight of each edge will be the number of shared lines of code.

python
Copy code
import networkx as nx

# Create an empty graph
graph = nx.Graph()

# Iterate over the rows of the DataFrame
for _, row in data.iterrows():
    id1 = row['ID1']
    id2 = row['ID2']
    overlap_id1 = row['% in ID1']
    overlap_id2 = row['% in ID2']
    shared_lines = row['number identical lines']

    # Add an edge if the overlap is at least 10% in either submission
    if overlap_id1 >= 10 or overlap_id2 >= 10:
        # Add the edge with the weight of shared lines of code
        graph.add_edge(id1, id2, weight=shared_lines)
Step 3: Network Size and Components
Let's calculate the number of nodes, edges, and connected components in the network.

python
Copy code
# Number of nodes
num_nodes = graph.number_of_nodes()

# Number of edges
num_edges = graph.number_of_edges()

# Number of connected components
num_components = nx.number_connected_components(graph)

# Print the results
print("Number of nodes:", num_nodes)
print("Number of edges:", num_edges)
print("Number of connected components:", num_components)
Step 4: Distribution of Edge Weights
Next, we will plot the distribution of edge weights and observe the results.

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Extract the edge weights from the graph
edge_weights = [data['weight'] for _, _, data in graph.edges(data=True)]

# Plot the distribution of edge weights
plt.hist(edge_weights, bins=10, alpha=0.7)
plt.xlabel("Edge Weight")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.title("Distribution of Edge Weights")
plt.show()
Step 5: Node Degree Distribution
Now, we'll plot the node degree distribution to analyze the connectivity of nodes in the network.

python
Copy code
# Calculate the node degrees
node_degrees = dict(graph.degree())

# Plot the node degree distribution
plt.hist(node_degrees.values(), bins=20, alpha=0.7)
plt.xlabel("Node Degree")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.title("Node Degree Distribution")
plt.show()
Step 6: Centrality Analysis
To identify the most central nodes in the network, we can compute different centrality metrics and choose the appropriate one based on the network definition. Let's use the degree centrality as an example.

python
Copy code
# Calculate the degree centrality
degree_centrality = nx.degree_centrality(graph)

# Sort the nodes by degree centrality in descending order
sorted_nodes = sorted(degree_centrality.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

# Print the top 5 most central nodes
top_nodes = sorted
